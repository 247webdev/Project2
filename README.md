# Good&co. is a platform for sharing and receiving Good #

Either you are a web developer with time to give pro-bono web services to a local non-profit or have spare time over the weekend to contribute to a community garden, there is always something we can give. Good&co, offers everyone a place to do good things by matchmaking your profile with people in need.  

Scope of the project was one short week, from conceptulizing the initial project, to defining a minimum viable product, to design a faux company and design direction, to finally running test driven development and building the project. 

The project was built in Ruby on Rails, v 4.2.0.
